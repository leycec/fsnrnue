        # Whereas the Ultimate Edition 0.9.1 download is a minimal installer
        # conditionally downloading large patch files from remote hosts at runtime,
        # the Ultimate Edition 1.0.0 beta provides *NO* installer but instead
        # unconditionally bundles all large patch files in a single mega.nz-hosted
        # 1.93GB zipfile intended to be extracted over existing 0.9.1
        # installations. So, we only automatically download the 0.9.1 release.
        # Hopefully, the official 1.0.0 release will revert back to an installer.

      #FIXME: Preserved in the likelihood that a subsequent WINE version will
      #yet again break F/SN, at which we'll have to temporarily pin against a
      #WINE version known to support F/SN. Thankfully, WINE is behaving itself.
      # The Ultimate Edition installer is fundamentally broken under WINE >=
      # 6.6.1 < 6.14.3, which silently pretends to succeed despite failing to
      # do anything with command-line errors resembling:
      #     0108:err:module:import_dll Library setupapi.dll (which is needed by L"C:\\windows\\system32\\user32.dll") not found

      # This is a well-known issue purportedly resolved by WINE 6.7:
      #     https://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=35192
      # Since we can confirm that WINE 6.10 suffers the same exact issue, we
      # avoid all WINE versions in this problematic range. See also this list
      # of supported Lutris runners:
      #     https://lutris.net/api/runners
      # In order to keep with the newer versions of wine the default version is set to 6.21-5. This has been tested and shown to work.
