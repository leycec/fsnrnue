        # conditionally downloading large patch files from remote hosts at runtime,
        # the Ultimate Edition 1.0.0 beta provides *NO* installer but instead
        # unconditionally bundles all large patch files in a single mega.nz-hosted
        # 1.93GB zipfile intended to be extracted over existing 0.9.1
        # installations. So, we only automatically download the 0.9.1 release.
        # Hopefully, the official 1.0.0 release will revert back to an installer.
